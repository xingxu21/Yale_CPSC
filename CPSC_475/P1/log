----  -------  ----  --------------
9/09  12:20pm  2:30	read assignment, wrote code for reading in inputs, wrote code for determing valid moves for a position (up, down, left, right)
9/10  4:30pm   1:00 wrote some helper functions, wrote pesudo code for the algorithm.
9/10  6:14pm   2:30 continued working on helper functions and implimened BFS to find new start positions after a move.
9/10  9:30pm.  1:30 code 99% way there. gotta do a lil bit of debugging   Will probably need to change my backtracking algorithm
9/11  11:30	   2:30 Figured out that there was a problem with my backtracking component. Tried again.

               10:00  TOTAL time spent

I had a hard time thinking correctly about the backtracking algorithm: at first I thought it would be a modified version of BFS, but after having a quick chat with Matt Tu, i saw the light and realized the error of my ways. After that, I had a few problems with correctly undoing my moves, but I was able to sort that out fairly quickly. my test 10 and 11 also happen pretty instantaneously, so i think i'm good on the runtime front
