# Yale_CPSC

Assignments and projects from CPSC courses I have taken at Yale. 

To the students who may be reading this:
1. If you copy stuff, you're cheating. Yale CPSC professors make it clear 
   that our code is MOSSed. You will be caught. Don't do it. 
2. Don't copy my code.

If you are a Prof reading this:
It is my understanding that assignments are changed from year to year, and 
I have uploaded these assignments to demonstrate my ability to write code for 
fairly complex projects. 

If you would like me to take down anything, I would be more than happy to.
