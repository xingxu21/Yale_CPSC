break explode bomb //will break before calling explode bomb

break *(17638349) //sets a break point at memory address 


info registers //givves info on the value of registers




pointers tend to be large values



sscanf <-like scanf but instead of taking input from stdin, takes in input at a pointer and there is a format field telling us what type it is. Google sscanf documentation for better explination


p (char*)(0x03940da0) //inturperet the number as a character and print it out (gdb can take inputs in c and do operations on them and then print them)



setp i //allows for stepping by instruction step by step


p/x //will print stuff in hex
