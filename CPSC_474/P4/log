I understand MCTS well, but i had extreme difficulty debugging. I tried many may different values of constants, and nothing worked, so I switched to implementing along the pesudocode presented in wikipedia. After that did not work, I tried to re-implement what was dicscussed in class, and it finaly worked. After submitting around noon, I decided to spend some more time optimizing the constant and was able to achieve very good results. I used ALL of my late days on this assignment...
