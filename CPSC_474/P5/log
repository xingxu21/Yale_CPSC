I began by rewatching some lectures and googling before writing out some skeleton code with descriptions of what functions should be doing. Also read through the nfl_strategy module to get a sense of what was going on. Was able to do this in one day. Had trouble with some debugging, had some minor issues with how I was doing rewards and as a result was having very bad results (around 0.016), was able to improve after finding the bug in how rewards are handled. After that, I mostly worked on messing with learning rate to try and improve. Was able to achieve 0.49 consistently for 0 and 0.46 for 1. At the suggestion of a piazza post, worked on messing with some constants to try and achieve better results.
