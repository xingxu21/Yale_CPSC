 * represents an area bounded by two circles of latitude and two
 * meridians of longitude.  The circle of latitude bounding the top of
 * the top row is the northernmost (highest) latitude of any
 * trackpoint in the given track.  The meridian bounding the left of
 * the first column is the western edge of the smallest spherical
 * wedge bounded by two meridians that contains all the points in the
 * track (the "western edge" for a nontrivial wedge being the one
 * that, when you move east from it along the equator, you stay in the
 * wedge).  When there are multiple such wedges, choose the one with
 * the lowest normalized (adjusted to the range -180 (inclusive) to
 * 180 (exclusive)) longitude of its western edge.  The distance (in
 * degrees) between the bounds of adjacent rows and columns is given
 * by the last two parameters.  The heat map will have just enough
 * rows and just enough columns so that all points in the track fall
 * into some cell.  The value in each entry in the heatmap is the
 * number of trackpoints located in the corresponding cell.  If a
 * trackpoint is on the border of two or more cells then it is counted
 * in the bottommost and rightmost cell it is on the border of, but do
 * not add a row or column just to place points on the south and east
 * borders into them and instead place the points on those borders by
 * breaking ties only between cells that already exist.  If the
 * eastermost cells have wrapped around to overlap the westernmost
 * cells then place points that belong to both in the westernmost
 * cells.  If there are no trackpoints in the track then the function
 * creates a 1x1 heatmap with the single element having a value of 0.
 * If the cell size is invalid or if there is a memory allocation
 * error then the map is set to NULL and the rows and columns
 * parameters are unchanged.  It is the caller's responsibility to
 * free each row in the returned array and the array itself.
