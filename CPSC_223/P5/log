11/17  6:00pm  4:00  Printed out assignment. Googled lots of kd tree stuff and though about implementation
11/18  6:00pm  2:00  Wrote pesudeocode for everything, though more about NN algorithm
11/19  8:00pm  3:00  Did some going over of pesudocode and worked out some kinks. Finally understand NN algo
11/20  6:00pm  6:00	 Implemented everuthing except NN and Create
11/21  9:00am  3:00  Implemented NN and Create. Tested, debugged
11/22  5:00pm  2:00  Worked out some final bugs when I had time in the afternoon and submitted.

I discussed NN with Eric Zhang and Christine Yang. Discussed Created with David C.

This one was fairly breezy. Got into zone with implementing stuff and was able to implement everything except NN and create in one sitting. The thing I actually had the most trouble with was actually understanding how exactly the NN algorithm worked: i had found some different descriptions of Kd trees online and a lot of them actually didn't create balanced trees, nor did they preprocess the points by first sorting by x and y and then starting off with the median. I probably spent the majority of the first two days I worked on the problem trying to work out how to do the NN algorighm myself, so that was a lot of drawing trees and then considering how to actually traverse though the tree to find the nearest thing. I eventually kinda discovered the answer by myself, but Eric and Christine gave me the last lil bit of a push over the edge so that I finally understood how to get the algo. My own version of the algo only would work with balanced trees and didn't actually guarntee finding the correct NN, just a "relatively" close one. 
Mergesort was gotten from Aspnes's notes
